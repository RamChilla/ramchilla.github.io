## Content-oriented problem solving.

I like to meet business rules through smart content management systems. Content management is meant to empower content editors without losing sight of larger contexts. I believe feature development should be purposeful, and treated as an extension of business processes.

## Keeping it tidy.

Code should be as elegant, where semantics allows, as the experience it creates. As developers, we strive for straight-forward, human-readable, and reusable solutions. A logical content systems configuration not only benefits clients, but future developers as well.

## Plan &amp; strategize.

Planning a content strategy is crucial in building not only an easy management experience, but also allows to build complex relationships and describe contexts across particular content types. Data could be unique to you, and a proper content plan can be a roadmap to not only development, but future best practices.

## Layered approach.

A good approach is to think about any web project as an application with layers. Build the layers and it will naturally become a full-fledged system. Front-end experiences are a great example where content, presentation, and interactivity have a direct relationship with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Building web experiences in layers helps graceful degradation be easier.
