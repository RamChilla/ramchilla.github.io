## A lover of the visual arts.

I admire photographers with a great eye for capturing intriguing moments and geometric landscapes. I also enjoy the urban art scene and thankful that Toledo has so many great murals around the city.

## A PC builder, gamer &amp; squadmate.

I enjoy working with PC hardware and like to build my own computers as well as those of friends. Gaming on PC/console is a part of my life and I typically enjoy simulators and first-person shooters. Hanging out with friends online can be quite the social hour.
