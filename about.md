# About my general approach&hellip;

{:.subtitle.mt-0}
## Content-oriented problem solving

Feature development should be purposeful and as an extension of business processes. Business rules met through smart content management systems enable and empower managers without losing sight of larger contexts.

## Logicality &amp; tidyness

Code should be as elegant as the experience it creates. Strive towards straight-forward, human-readable, and reusable solutions. A logical content systems configuration benefits all project stakeholders, present and future.

## Plan &amp; strategize

Planning a content strategy is crucial in building not only an easy management experience, but also complex relationships. Content strategy can describe contexts across particular content types. Data could be unique to you, and a proper content plan can be a development roadmap for future best practices.

## Layer the approach

A good approach is to think about any web project as an application with layers. Build the layers and it will naturally become a full-fledged system. Front-end experiences are a great example where content, presentation, and interactivity have a direct relationship with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Building web experiences in layers helps graceful degradation be easier.

## A lover of the visual arts

I admire photographers with a great eye for capturing intriguing moments and geometric landscapes. I also enjoy the urban art scene and am thankful that there are so many great murals around my city.
